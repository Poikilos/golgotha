       Terrain Rendering and transparency bitmap

            Dear all, 

            I don't know if anybody has noticed that the rendering of remote 
            terrain has some bugs. This causes incorrect texture mapping for 
            remote scene. You can easily observe that the moutain outside of a 
            distance will be rendered incorrectly(the shape and the texture 
            keeps changing when your view point moves) as you walk around the 
            demo scene. After tracking this problem for a long time by trial and 
            error, I have the following findings: 

            if the following changes are made to map_lod.cc: 

            // area metric 
            i4_float dz1,dz2; 

            dz1 = z22 - z21; 
            dz2 = z11 - z21; 
            p->metric = (float)sqrt(dz1*dz1 + dz2*dz2 + 1); 
            dz1 = z22 - z12; 
            dz2 = z11 - z12; 
            p->metric += dz1*dz1 + dz2*dz2 + 1; 

            to 


            // area metric 
            i4_float dz1,dz2; 

            dz1 = z22 - z21; 
            dz2 = z11 - z21; 
            p->metric = dz1*dz1 + dz2*dz2 + 1; 
            dz1 = z22 - z12; 
            dz2 = z11 - z12; 
            p->metric += dz1*dz1 + dz2*dz2 + 1; 

            AND 

            int mx = (x1+x2)/2, my = (y1+y2)/2; 

            i4_float fx = pos.x - mx, fy = pos.y - my, fz = pos.z - 
            g1_get_vertex(mx,my)->get_height(); 
            i4_float d1 = fx*fx+fy*fy+fz*fz; 
            i4_float d2 = p->metric*20; 

            to 

            int mx = (x1+x2)/2, my = (y1+y2)/2; 

            i4_float fx = pos.x - mx, fy = pos.y - my, fz = pos.z - 
            g1_get_vertex(mx,my)->get_height(); 
            i4_float d1 = fx*fx+fy*fy+fz*fz; 
            i4_float d2 = p->metric*400; 

            (you can find this easily by searching for the word 'metric'), the 
            problem seems to be completely solved. My question is: 

            Do anybody know what is T intersection fixing appeared in 
            map_lod.cc: 

            // T intersection fixing 

            // Map of directions 
            // dzdx2 
            // z22* ----> * 
            // ^ ^ 
            // dzdy1 | | dzdy2 
            // | | 
            // z12* ----> * 
            // z11 dzdx1 z21 

            What is the underlying theory behind the terrain rendering used in 
            golgotha engine? 

            Besides this, I have tried to delete both g_compressed and 
            g_decompressed directories and then use 

            maxtool_debug -update demo.scm 

            to regenerate the texture cache. This works but the texture mapping 
            nows has no transparency effect; (for example, the transparent part 
            in texture for tree is rendered in 
            pink); how can I achieve transparency effect? 


            Thanks for your attension.

            Wai Fu

            It's good to see someone actually doing something with Golgotha. 
            I'll see if I can solve your transparency problem this weekend if I 
            have time. 
            Jonathan might actually know answer to your questions and if he ever 
            actually 
            read this forum he might help (JC, if you do, remove those flash 4.0 
            crack messages).

            Oliver Yu wrote all of the terrain LOD code, and you can contact him 
            at oliy@crack.com. A T-intersection is the case were you subdivision 
            occurs on one block but not the ajoining block (making a T shape) 

            A-B 
            -C- 

            A and B are subdivided and C is joined. The edge that they share 
            need to have the same value both times it is rendered or there will 
            be cracks in the ground.

            Are you are of the fact that if I change 
            i4_float d2 = p->metric*20; into i4_float d2 = p->metric*400; 
            it makes everything slower, 
            at least on my computer the fps dropped from 250 into 35...
