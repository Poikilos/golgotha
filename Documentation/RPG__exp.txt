How to get experience
*********************

You are alone
-------------

A list is kept for each enemy you attacked but didn't kill. This list has limited size. 
If it gets full, the oldest entry is dropped. Each entry contains the damage you've
done and the reference to the enemy. 
When the enemy dies, you get the experience points (exp) from him and the entry is dropped.
If the enemy's health increases again (i.e slowly on his own or he takes a potion), 
the exp he has to spend increase, too. 
These extra-exp drop back to normal quite fast.
When the enemy reaches full health, all list-references to him are dropped. (This is to 
avoid that you get exp for an enemy completelly killed by someone else later)

You are a party
---------------
If the monster dies, the lists of all players involved in the kill are accessed and 
the sum of the damage they made is calculated. This sum might be larger than the maximum
health of the enemy. The exp points are distributed related to the ratio of each player
to this sum. It is much likely that if the sum is larger than the maximum health, the exp
is also larger than usual, because the enemy has healed itself. 

A monster killed by a party should give more exp for each player than if he's alone, such
that the party members don't increase their level to slowly. But multiplying the exp points
by the number of members won't do the trick, because that would make a party too strong as 
they have at some point the same level as a lonely fighter but are two or three. 
I'd suggest each successive member in a party increases the exp by 0.75. 

These rules don't even need the players to be an explicitly stated party, they could also 
just happen to be attacking the same enemy by coincidence.
