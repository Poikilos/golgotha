		GOLGOTHA DEMO 5 README<br>

		<P><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT">
		<TR><TD ALIGN="Center"><FONT COLOR="#8080FF"><B>&nbsp;Status Bars, Radar, and Vehicles&nbsp;</B></FONT>
		<HR WIDTH=100></TD></TR></TABLE><p>
		The status bar is designed with screen space, rather than
beauty, in mind.  We sacrafice an ornate status bar for a functional one
which allows you to see more of the screen at any moment.  We used colored bars and icons
		for the supertank weapons so that you could more easily measure them in your peripheral view.
		The purchase buttons up top are large enough to click fairly quickly but small enough to
		be unobtrustive.  The radar map is one pixel per map tile.  It gets larger or smaller according
		to the size of the level.
		</p><p>
		The bottom status bar has four important
		statistics for your supertank, assuming you have a supertank.  One of those is ARMOR.  This is the
		same as "hit points" in D&amp;D parlance.  When you run out of ARMOR, your supertank is dead.  You
		will need to purchase another if you want a new one.  There is no sense of "lives".  When your
		supertank dies, you just need more cash- a lot more cash.  You may have to wait for that cash while your opponent
		takes the opportunity to make a power play, just like hockey, and crushes you like a bug.
		Keep an eye on your armor and other vital supertank statistics.  If any stat gets unacceptably
		low, remember that you can go inside your base anytime and get free ammo and repairs!
		</p><p>
		Another stat in the lower status bar is the CHAIN GUN, which is the measure of how many
		chain gun rounds are left.  You fire the chain gun with the "0" key on the numeric keypad.  All
		chain gun shots will aim automatically in a 360-degree radius around you.  They pack a
		sizable punch.  Just hold it down and watch vehicles turn black.  Though short-ranged and the
		weakest of the three, you'll often find this is one of the last weapons you have remaining,
		and proficient use can easily save your butt.
		</p><p>
		The MAIN GUN measures exactly how many main gun rounds you have left.  These rounds pack a
		real punch.  You can take out almost any vehicle on the field in literally one or two shots if
		you hit with the main gun.  But be careful.  You have only a couple dozen rounds.
		</p><p>
		The MISSILES are a devastating weapon.  They each break into three warheads.  Each warhead
		is guided and does massive damage.  If you connect with all three warheads on an enemy supertank,
		you will take it out.  If you kill the enemy's supertank, it's a stunning blow and a chance to
		make a power-play and win the level!  But watch out.  The enemy supertank has these missiles, too,
		and he will fire on you at first site.
		</p><p>
		The top status bar has a series of vehicle purchase icons.  On the very left side is the supertank
		icon.  If you put your mouse over it, you will see the cost of purchasing a supertank.  $10 billion.
		Not cheap.  The supertank is an exceptional vehicle, and you should never lose your supertank
		unless you can afford to.  Other vehicles cost anywhere from a few hundred million to a
		one or two billion dollars.  Not so bad.
		</p><p>
		The other seven vehicle purchase buttons are:
		<el>
			<li><b>Tank</b>: One of the most cost-effective vehicles, but easy to out-do if you
				have the cash.</li>
			<li><b>Kamikaze Trike</b>: A terrifying vehicle, this thing will seperate from
				the formation and will scream towards its target, exploding and packing
				a massive wallop.</li>
			<li><b>Missile Truck</b>: Expensive, but worth it.  These monsters are your best
				defense against helicopters and jump jets, and they have awesome
				range, but they're easy to pop.</li>
			<li><b>Jump Jet</b>: Not very accurate, but it has an area-of-effect bomb that can
				really harass the enemy supertank and make minced-meat of formations without
				missile-toting escorts.</li>
			<li><b>Electric Car</b>: Can't fire to the sides very well at all, but if you're in
				front of one of these nasties, it's all over.  A small formation of electric
				cars makes an awesome offensive group and can take out supertanks singlehandedly.</li>
			<li><b>Helicopter</b>: Fires missiles twice as fast as the missile truck, it flies, and it flies fast.  You
				can't put many of these in a formation, but they're a great way to defend a
				weak group on the other side of the map or to take out any enemy convoys unwise
				enough to leave home without missile defenses.</li>
			<li><b>Engineering Vehicle</b>:
This vehicle has no defenses and no offenses, but the engineering vehicle
is the only one that can win the game for you.
When one of
these vehicles successfully reaches a building's takeover pad, you win
control of the building.  If you get an engineering
				vehicle to the enemy's base, you win the level!  Capture a bank, and your income rate will
				increase dramatically!  Engineering Vehicles are ultimately the key to victory.</li>
		</el>
		</p><p>
		To the right of the vehicle purchase buttons, is your bank balance and the cost of what you're
		about to purchase (whatever you are holding the mouse cursor over).  Your bank balance increases
		automatically at a constant rate.  If you take over a bank, it will increase faster.  Multiple banks
		have cumulative effects.  Banks are the only special buildings in this demo.
		</p><p>
		To the right of the bank balance and cost field is the option menu button.  Click on this and the
		vehicles will be replaced by options.  More about these options can be found under the
		<a href="r4.html">Options</a> section.
		</p><p>
		To the right of your option menu button is the radar screen.  Anytime there is a lull, your
		eyes should be glued to this screen.  Keep an eye out for the red flashing dot.  That's the enemy
		supertank, and he will kill your supertank on site!  All the other red dots are enemy vehicles or
		charred enemy remains.  All the blue dots are on your team.  The flashing dot is your supertank.
		Yellow dots represent your currently selected formation.
		You can click on the radar at any time to cause the game to go into the Strategy View and to zoom
		into the specified location.  The yellow brackets on the radar show where the Strategy View is
		currently pointing.  These brackets change in size because sometimes it is looking from way up on top
		of a mountain, and other times, it is looking at the bottom of a valley.

		"Between Demo 4 and Demo 5, we primarily focused on getting
		software rendering working and at an acceptable rate on a wide range of machines.  The gameplay, although it
		has made some progress with the addition of the
		base-reloading, an enemy super-tank, and our first stab at enemy AI, has still been largely overlooked.  But
		not to worry.  We feel these demos are healthy for the company and we do plan a Demo 6, perhaps even a
		Demo 7, before the game is released.  I would like to thank the people who have sent us drooling support for
		Golgotha, even at such an early stage.  We love the encouraging words."
