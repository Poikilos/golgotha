        <td>Q: Win95/NT : <strong>Running i4_make reports error
        saying bad command/file not found, what gives?<br>
        </strong>A: First if you have a windows directory other
        than c:\windows, you should reflect this in the
        i4_make.cc file and rebuild i4_make by running
        build_i4_make.bat. Second if i4_make tries to execute a
        command with a space in the filename, it will probably
        not work. Don't extract the source to a directory such as
        &quot;Program Files/golgotha&quot;. To see the command
        i4_make is having a problem with, run &quot;i4_make
        -v&quot;. &quot;i4_make -?&quot; will report other
        possibly useful switches.<p>Q: <strong>What does it mean
        when it says &quot;golgotha.cd&quot; is missing? <br>
        </strong>A: Golgotha.cd is like a doom WAD file or a
        ZIP/TAR file. It can store a bunch of files in one file.
        This reduces the clutter for the end user. However during
        development it is a pain to have to rebuild this file
        everytime you run the game. So when golgotha opens a file
        it looks inside the golgotha.cd file first, if it is not
        found it will read the file from your hard drive. In this
        release we do not have a golgotha.cd file, so all files
        are read from your hard drive. You can use the cd_maker
        program (included) to build a golgotha.cd file. If you
        do, you may wish to use the command line option
        &quot;-netfirst&quot; when running golgotha. This causes
        golgotha to first read from your hard drive, then from
        golgotha.cd if the file is missing.</p>
        <p>Q: <strong>I want to use Golgotha's rendering code in
        my game, where do I start?<br>
        </strong>A: Checkout the test/<a
        href="http://www.crack.com/golgotha_release/test/spin_cube/spin_cube.cc">spin_cube</a>
        program. It renders a spinning cube with a texture
        applied and it pretty heavily commented.</p>
        <p>Q: <strong>What is the structure of 3d model file
        format (.gmod) for Golgotha?<br>
        </strong>A: See the <a href="gmod_format.html">golgotha
        model format description</a>.</p>
